# Simple Card Game

This project is intended to be a simple example of how OOP works in Python.

It was made as an example solution for an exercises proposed to the Nimbus Intelligence cohort of February 2025. There may be sub-optimal decisions, since it was made in just a couple hours. If I have time I will add documentation and clean it up a bit.
